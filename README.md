# The Wedding Ritual

This talk was first given at Lean Agile Glasgow, on December 14th 2016.

The slides are available in the original Markdown format (the-wedding-ritual.md), which can be opened using [Deckset](http://decksetapp.com). The theme should default to Poster variant 8, which is plain black text on a white background.

I've expanded the speaker notes from the original a little, explaining the ideas more fully.

If you don't have access to Deckset but still want the visuals alongside the notes, I've exported the slides as a PDF. (There aren't many visuals in this talk).
